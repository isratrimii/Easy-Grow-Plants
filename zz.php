    <b>ZZ plant care</b> <br><br>

    <b>Potting Mix:</b><br>
<b>Well-draining:</b>
ZZ plants are susceptible to root rot if their roots are constantly wet, so a well-draining mix is essential. <br>
<b>Recommended Mixes:</b>
Miracle-Gro Tropical Potting Mix, or a mix of perlite, peat moss, and sand or vermiculite can be used. <br>
<b>Light:</b> <br>
<b>Bright Indirect Light:</b>
ZZ plants thrive in bright, indirect light, but can also tolerate low light conditions. <br>
<b>Avoid Direct Sunlight:</b>
Too much direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, so avoid placing them in direct sunlight for extended periods. <br>
<b>Watering:</b><br>
<b>Allow Soil to Dry:</b>
ZZ plants prefer infrequent watering, and the soil should be allowed to dry out completely between waterings.<br>
<b>Water Thoroughly:</b>
When you do water, water thoroughly until water drains from the bottom of the pot.<br>
<b>Discard Excess Water:</b>
Remove any excess water from the saucer after watering to prevent root rot. <br>
<b>Fertilizing:</b><br>
<b>Minimal Need:</b>
ZZ plants generally don't require much fertilizer, especially if they are in a well-draining mix.<br>
<b>Optional Fertilization:</b>
If you choose to fertilize, use a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half-strength every 2-3 months during the growing season (spring and summer). <br>
<b>Humidity:</b>
<b>Average Humidity:</b> ZZ plants do not require extra humidity and can tolerate average indoor humidity levels. <br>
<b>Temperature:</b><br>
<b>Average Room Temperature:</b> ZZ plants prefer average room temperatures between 65째F and 85째F (18째C and 30째C). <br>
<b>Pruning:</b>
<b>Prune as Needed:</b> You can prune ZZ plants by cutting the stems back to the soil line if desired. <br>
<b>Other Considerations:</b><br>
<b>Toxic to Pets and Humans:</b> ZZ plants contain calcium oxalate crystals, which can be irritating to pets and humans if ingested. <br>
<b>Low-Maintenance:</b> ZZ plants are generally low-maintenance and can be grown by beginners.
