    <b>Fern plant care</b> <br><br>
    <b>Soil and Potting Mix:</b><br>
<b>Well-draining:</b> Ferns need soil that drains well to prevent root rot, so avoid heavy clay soils. <br>
<b>Moist but not soggy:</b> Maintain a consistently moist soil, but ensure excess water drains away. <br>
<b>Organic matter:</b> Ferns benefit from soil rich in organic matter, like compost or leaf mold. <br>
<b>Suggested mix:</b> A good mix for ferns is 50% potting soil, 25% compost or aged manure, 10% perlite or sand,<br>
 10% peat moss or coconut coir, and 5% leaf mold or well-rotted pine bark. <br>
<b>Watering:</b><br>
<b>Water thoroughly:</b>
Water fern plants until water drains from the bottom of the pot, indicating the soil is saturated. <br>
<b>Avoid splashing leaves:</b>
When watering, aim water at the base of the plant to avoid splashing the fronds, which can lead to fungal diseases. <br>
<b>Consistent moisture:</b>
Keep the soil consistently moist, but not soggy, to prevent underwatering or overwatering stress. <br>
<b>Misting:</b><br>
Mist ferns regularly, especially those that prefer high humidity, to maintain moisture in the air. <br>
<b>Light:</b><br>
<b>Bright, indirect light:</b>
Ferns prefer bright, indirect light, which can be achieved with filtered sunlight or by placing them away from direct sunlight.<br>
<b>Avoid direct sun:</b>
Direct sunlight can burn delicate fern fronds, especially during hot summer months. <br>
<b>Humidity:</b>
High humidity: Ferns thrive in high humidity, ideally between 50-70%.<br>
<b>Increase humidity:</b> Use a humidifier, mist the leaves, or create a pebble tray with water to raise humidity levels. <br>
<b>Temperature:</b><br>
<b>Moderate temperatures:</b>
Ferns prefer moderate temperatures, around 65-70째F (18-21째C) during the day and 10째F (6째C) cooler at night. <br>
<b>Avoid temperature extremes:</b>
Keep ferns away from drafts, fireplaces, or air vents to prevent temperature fluctuations. <br>
<b>Fertilization:</b><br>
<b>Fertilize during growing season:</b>
Fertilize ferns with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer every 4-6 weeks during the growing season (spring and summer).<br>
<b>Use a weak solution:</b>
Use a half-strength fertilizer to avoid over-fertilizing, which can harm the fern. <br>
<b>Other Care Tips:</b><br>
<b>Prune dead fronds:</b> Remove dead or brown fronds to encourage new growth. <br>
<b>Repotting:</b> Repot ferns as needed, usually every 1-2 years, using fresh soil and a pot that's slightly larger. <br>
<b>Pest and disease:</b> Monitor for pests and diseases and treat promptly if necessary. <br>
