    <b>Caladium plant care</b> <br><br>

    <b>Planting and Media:</b><br>
<b>Soil:</b><br>
Caladiums prefer well-drained, slightly acidic soil rich in organic matter. Use a mix of high-quality potting mix with compost or other organic matter for potted caladiums. 
<b>Potting:</b>
Plant caladium tubers 2 inches deep, with the eyes facing upward, in pots at least 6 inches deep. Ensure pots have ample drainage holes. 
<b>Watering:</b><br>
Keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy, especially in the summer. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry, especially for potted plants. <br>
<b>Care:</b><br>
<b>Sunlight:</b> Caladiums prefer bright, indirect light or dappled shade, as direct sunlight can scorch their leaves. <br>
<b>Temperature and Humidity:</b> Caladiums thrive in warm temperatures (65-85Â°F) and high humidity. Use a humidifier or frequent misting to increase humidity. <br>
<b>Fertilizer: </b> regularly, especially during the growing season, with a balanced, slow-release fertilizer. <br>
<b>Overwintering:</b> In colder climates, caladium tubers should be dug up and stored indoors during the winter, allowing the foliage to die back after the first frost. <br>
<b>Pruning:</b> Remove yellowed or spent leaves to encourage new growth. <br>
<b>Propagation:</b> Bulbs can be split and propagated every 2 years. <br>
<b>Additional Tips:</b><br>
Use mulch to retain moisture and suppress weeds.<br>
Avoid placing caladiums near vents, which can dehydrate them.<br>
Handle caladiums carefully during repotting, as they have delicate leaves and roots. <br>
